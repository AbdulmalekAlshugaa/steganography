# Image Steganography
Steganography is the process of hiding a secret message within a larger one in such a way that someone  cannot know the presence or contents of the hidden message. Although related, Steganography is not to be confused with Encryption, which is the process of making a message unintelligibleâ€”Steganography attempts to hide the existence of communication.
The main advantage of steganography algorithm is because of its simple security mechanism. Because the steganographic message is integrated invisibly and covered inside other harmless sources, it is very difficult to detect the message without knowing
the existence and the appropriate encoding scheme .

# Proposed Algorithm
The algorithm is more dedicated towards the algorithm proposed by Rosziati Ibrahim and Teoh Suk Kuan in their [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1112/1112.2809.pdf) published on February 25, 2011.
## Encoding Algorithm
- Firstly, the secret message that is extracted is `compressed` as the contents in the compressed string will significantly hard to detect and read, furthermore it reduces the size of string.
- Secondly, the compressed string is `encrypted` with the secret key.
- Finally, `encoding` the encrypted message in the image. It uses `LSB steganographic embedding` to encode data into an image. Once the message is encoded the process stops.
### LSB(Least Significant Bit) Embedding
The LSB is the lowest significant bit in the byte value of the image pixel.
The  LSB  based  image  steganography  embeds  the  secret  in the  least  significant  bits  of  pixel  values  of  the  cover  image (CVR).
The concept of LSB Embedding is simple. It exploits the fact that the level of precision in many image formats is far greater than that perceivable by average human vision. Therefore, an altered image with slight variations in its colors will be indistinguishable from the original by a human being, just by looking at it. In conventional LSB technique, which requires eight bytes of pixels to store 1byte of secret data but in proposed LSB technique, just four bytes of pixels are sufficient to hold one message byte. Rest of the bits in the pixels remains the same.
Following shows the bit level interpretation of the algorithm :

## Decoding Algorithm
- Firstly, `decode` the message from the encrypted image using LSB decoding.

- Secondly, `decrypt` the compressed message from the decoded message using the secret key.

- Finally, `decompress` the message to get the original compressed message.   

Consider the following encoding, it is totally undetectable by human eyes.

# Usage
Add it in your root `build.gradle` at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
Now add the following dependency in your app's `build.gradle`
```groovy
dependencies {
      implementation 'com.github.aagarwal1012:Image-Steganography-Library-Android:v1.0'
}
```
## How to encode message into an image ?
**Note :** Your Activity class should implements `TextEncodingCallback` interface and also contains its `override` methods.

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements TextEncodingCallback 
```
- Firstly, instantiate the `ImageSteganography` object and pass the values `Message	`, `Secret Key` and `Image Bitmap` to the constructor.

  ```java
  ImageSteganography imageSteganography = new ImageSteganography(message, 
                                          secret_key, 
                                          original_image);
  ```

- Secondly, instantiate the `TextEncoding` object and pass the values `Activity` and `TextEncodingCallback` object to the constructor.

  ```java
  TextEncoding textEncoding = new TextEncoding(MainActivity.this,
                              MainActivity.this);
  ```

- Finally, execute our `encoding` task.

  ```java
  textEncoding.execute(imageSteganography);
  ```
**Note** : By default a `ProgressDialog` will appear in the process of text encoding.

#### Override Methods

- `OnStartTextEncoding()` : In this method you can whatever by the start of text encoding process.  

  ```java
  @Override
      public void onStartTextEncoding() {
          //Whatever you want to do at the start of text encoding
      }
  ```

- `onCompleteTextEncoding()` : After the completion of text encoding, this method is called and gives result.

  ```java
  @Override
      public void onCompleteTextEncoding(ImageSteganography result) {
  
          //After the completion of text encoding.
          
          //result object is instantiated 
          this.result = result;
  
          if (result != null && result.isEncoded()){
              
              //encrypted image bitmap is extracted from result object
              encoded_image = result.getEncrypted_image();
              
              //set text and image to the UI component.
              textView.setText("Encoded");
              imageView.setImageBitmap(encoded_image);
      }
  ```
## How to decode message from an image ?
**Note :** Your Activity class should implements `TextDecodingCallback` interface and also contains its `override` methods.

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements TextDecodingCallback 
```
- Firstly, instantiate the `ImageSteganography` object and pass the values `Secret Key` and `Image Bitmap` to the constructor.

  ```java
  ImageSteganography imageSteganography = new ImageSteganography(secret_key,
                                          original_image);
  ```

- Secondly, instantiate the `TextDecoding` object and pass the values `Activity` and `TextDecodingCallback` object to the constructor.

  ```java
  TextDecoding textDecoding = new TextDecoding(MainActivity.this, 
                              MainActivity.this);
  ```

- Finally, execute our `decoding` task.

  ```java
  textDecoding.execute(imageSteganography);
  ```
  **Note** : By default a `ProgressDialog` will appear in the process of text decoding.

#### Override Methods

- `OnStartTextDecoding()` : In this method you can whatever by the start of text decoding process.  

  ```java
  @Override
      public void onStartTextDecoding() {
          //Whatever you want to do at the start of text encoding
      }
  ```

- `onCompleteTextDecoding()` : After the completion of text decoding, this method is called and gives result.

  ```java
  @Override
      public void onCompleteTextEncoding(ImageSteganography result) {
  
          //After the completion of text encoding.
          
          //result object is instantiated 
          this.result = result;
  
          if (result != null){
              
              /* If result.isDecoded() is false, it means no Message was found in 					the image. */
              if (!result.isDecoded())
                  textView.setText("No message found");
              
              else{
                  /* If result.isSecretKeyWrong() is true, it means that secret key provided 				is wrong. */ 
                  if (!result.isSecretKeyWrong()){
                      //set the message to the UI component.
                      textView.setText("Decoded");
                      message.setText("" + result.getMessage());
                  }
                  else {
                      textView.setText("Wrong secret key");
                  }
              }
          }
          else {
              //If result is null it means that bitmap is null
              textView.setText("Select Image First");
          }
      }
  ```

### Example App

There are two options `Encode` and `Decode`. In the encode section you can hide a secret message into an image without making any noticeable changes. In the decode section you can extract the message from the encoded image by inserting the correct key.

**Note** - After pressing the `Save` button, both the original and encoded images are saved at the location ```Android/data/com.ayush.steganography/files/Documents/<UUID>/ ```
